# Reduced Order Modeling Tutorials

## Background and Objectives

This repository is a curated collection of tutorials that delve into various reduced-order modeling techniques. Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks as the instructional medium, these tutorials provide an interactive, hands-on approach to understanding complex computational models like DeepONet, FNO, POD-DL-ROM, and DL-ROM. Each notebook is designed to function as a standalone tutorial and includes provisions for automatic data retrieval, facilitating execution on both local machines and Google Colab environments.

## Installation and Requirements

To execute the tutorials, certain Python packages must be installed. This can be done by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebook Naming Convention

In order to facilitate ease of navigation and comprehension, a standard naming schema has been adopted for the Jupyter notebooks:

```
[Model]_[Equation/Problem+Dimension]_[TAG].ipynb
```

- **Model**: Represents the computational model or algorithm under study (e.g., FNO, DLROM).
- **Equation/Problem+Dimension**: Specifies the mathematical problem or equation being solved along with its spatial dimensions (e.g., Burgers1D, NOAA2D).
- **TAG**: An optional identifier providing supplementary context or categorizing the notebook's difficulty level or specific focus (e.g., Intro, Advanced, DataPrep).
