## Background and Objectives

This repository is a curated collection of tutorials that delve into various reduced-order modeling techniques. Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks as the instructional medium, these tutorials provide an interactive, hands-on approach to understanding complex computational models like DeepONet, FNO, POD-DL-ROM, and DL-ROM. Each notebook is designed to function as a standalone tutorial and includes provisions for automatic data retrieval, facilitating execution on both local machines and Google Colab environments.

---

## Installation and Requirements

To execute the tutorials, certain Python packages must be installed. This can be done by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebook Naming Convention

In order to facilitate ease of navigation and comprehension, a standard naming schema has been adopted for the Jupyter notebooks:

```
[Model]_[Equation/Problem+Dimension]_[TAG].ipynb
```

- **Model**: Represents the computational model or algorithm under study (e.g., FNO, DLROM).
- **Equation/Problem+Dimension**: Specifies the mathematical problem or equation being solved along with its spatial dimensions (e.g., Burgers1D, NOAA2D).
- **TAG**: An optional identifier providing supplementary context or categorizing the notebook's difficulty level or specific focus (e.g., Intro, Advanced, DataPrep).

This structured naming convention aims to simplify navigation and enrich the user's understanding of the content.
